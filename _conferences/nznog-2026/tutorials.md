We have several exciting tutorials for NZNOG 2026.

### BGP: Intermediate Operations & Best Practices
**Monday March 23 - Wednesday March 25**

*Presented by Philip Smith, NSRC*

Audience: Network engineers/ops staff with BGP in production; attendees should be comfortable with routing fundamentals and basic BGP CLI

By the end of the workshop, participants will be able to:

- Design and implement scalable, policy-driven BGP in ISP/enterprise networks
- Apply best practices for prefix filtering, RPKI/ROV, IRR route-policy hygiene
- Engineer traffic using BGP communities, MED/Local-Pref, and hot/cold potato strategies
- Troubleshoot path anomalies, convergence issues, and common failure modes
- Deploy BGP for IPv6 and dual-stack at scale

### 30 years of RADIUS in 3 hours - What you need to know
**Wednesday March 25**

*Presented by Alan DeKok, FreeRADIUS developer, and InkBridge Networks*

This workshop will cover RADIUS from its humble beginnings to its modern updates.  Topics will include design patterns that work (and ones that don't!), pitfalls, misunderstandings, "inventive" equipment behavior, and upcoming changes to the protocol.  Examples will be given using FreeRADIUS.

After following the workshop, attendees will be better able to design, build, debug, and maintain complex RADIUS environments.

### Build virtual network labs fast: a complete Containerlab workshop
**Wednesday March 25**

*Presented by Nokia*

We all need networking labs. Whether for learning, testing, or debugging, access to a virtual environment becomes transformative when physical hardware is scarce or expensive. Containerlab addresses this challenge by enabling rapid deployment of network topologies using Docker containers. Alongside its core features, Containerlab is fast, resource-efficient, open source, and completely free to use.
This workshop provides comprehensive, hands-on training with Containerlab, starting from fundamental concepts and progressively introducing advanced features and realistic use cases throughout the day.

After completing this workshop, participants will be able to, among other things:
- Deploy complex network topologies using Containerlab
- Understand the underlying connectivity mechanisms between containers
- Utilize advanced features and configurations in topology files
- Master the Containerlab VS Code extension for enhanced productivity
- Induce latency, jitter or packet loss in the network using embedded impairment tools
- Leverage Edgeshark for efficient traffic capture and analysis within Containerlab topologies

To ensure a productive learning experience, participants should ideally have:
- Basic Linux CLI proficiency: Familiarity with navigating the Linux file system, executing commands, and managing processes.
- Fundamental Docker knowledge: Understanding of Docker concepts such as images, containers, and basic Docker commands (e.g., docker run, docker ps).
- Experience with Visual Studio Code (VSC): Familiarity with the Visual Studio Code interface and basic operations.

Please bring a laptop, further details of required software and setup will be provided.
