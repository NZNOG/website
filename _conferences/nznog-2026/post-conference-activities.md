title: NZNOG 2026 Post Conference Activities
---

At NZNOG 2025, we facilitated some activities after the conference on Friday evening, for those who were staying the night. We got great feedback from this initiative, and will be doing this again.

NZNOG is facilitating, but these are not formal NZNOG events.

### Jetex Flight Simulator
Friday 27th March - from 5pm

*$110 per person*

1A Hawthornden Road, Avonhead, Christchurch

Experience an exact replica of the world's best-selling aircraft in aviation history - the Boeing 737. It is a CAA certified 'fixed base' flight training device and is used by commercial pilots, as a lead-in to full flight simulator (airline) training.  If you haven't flown before, no problem because you will be guided by a fully qualified simulator instructor. The high-tech instructor station (behind the pilots) allows us to set almost any scenario. You could be flying in Cairo, New York, London or Sydney. Incidentally, our most popular sector is Christchurch to Queenstown – its colourful, challenging and rewarding, if you get it right! And there are 50 Japanese Classic Motorcycles also on display (70s/80s/90s)!

Spots for this one are very limited, so please get in quickly as part of your registration. Payment for this will be required on booking.
