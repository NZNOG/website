title: NZNOG 2026 Call for Presentations
---

The NZNOG Trustees invite presentation proposals for the 23rd NZNOG conference, to be hosted at the Te Pae Christchurch Convention Centre from 23–27 March 2026.

## Conference objective:

The NZNOG conference, workshops and tutorials are an opportunity for individuals and organisations involved in Internet operations to meet and share the latest in Internet operations, technologies, practices and receive high quality training.

The event is unique in New Zealand and attracts technical, skilled individuals with a genuine interest in Internet operations and Internetworking technologies.

Submissions on any aspect of networking are welcome however we are particularly interested in presentations that involve real world operational experience, particularly in New Zealand.

Conference registration for accepted presenters will be free.

## Submit a proposal:

Presenters are invited to submit presentation proposals.  Talks will be reviewed and accepted (or rejected) as they are received.   Often we will have a discussion with a potential presenter to refine the proposed content and ensure it is appropriate for our audience.  We are also happy to have a chat about your idea before you make a proposal.

Please provide your talk title, a short presenter bio and a description of the proposed presentation. Description should be no more than one page long and provide a summary of your networking related subject matter.

Normally presentations are 30 min long, are video streamed live and slide decks are posted to the NZNOG website.  If you want a different duration or other arrangements please let us know at submission time.

To submit your proposal please e-mail: talks@nznog.org
