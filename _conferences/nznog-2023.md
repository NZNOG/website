Early bird pricing for the main conference will be available until December 24th 2022 @ $250. After which, the conference price will be $350 and available until sold out.
Tutorial and workshop pricing is available on the [registration](https://nznog-2023.lilregie.com/) page.

Accommodation will be available from Rydges, and other nearby hotels. See the [Accommodation](nznog-2023/accommodation) page for details when they become available.
From our negotiations with hotels it has become clear that due to the return of tourism, accommodation could be in short supply so we recommend booking early.

We do have arrangements in place to allow postponement of the conference if the pandemic resurges but at this stage we do not anticipate that it will be necessary.

We are seeking sponsors and will have a sponsorship document available. For details contact [sponsorship@nznog.org](mailto:sponsorship@nznog.org).
