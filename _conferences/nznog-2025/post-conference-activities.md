title: NZNOG 2025 Post Conference Activities
---

At NZNOG 2025 we are trying something new, and arranging some social activities after the conference finishes on Friday, as many attendees often stay overnight on Friday. We look forward to feedback on this!

Both activities this year are at the National Distillery. The distillery is a 5 minute drive from the conference venue, and there are many nice restaurants nearby.

NZNOG is facilitating, but these are not formal NZNOG events, and as such payment is direct to the venue at the time.

### Blend Your Own Gin Masterclass

During this 1.5 hour activity, you'll receive a welcome drink, tour of the distillery, then learn to blend your own gin and take home a 700ml bottle.

### Cocktail Masterclass

During this 1.5 hour activity, you'll receive a welcome drink, tour of the distillery, then learn to make 2 cocktails (and drink them!).
