title: NZNOG 2025 Post Conference Activities
---

At NZNOG 2025 we are trying something new, and arranging some social activities after the conference finishes on Friday, as many attendees often stay overnight on Friday. We look forward to feedback on this!

Both activities this year are at the National Distillery. The distillery is a 5 minute drive from the conference venue, and there are many nice restaurants nearby.

NZNOG is facilitating, but these are not formal NZNOG events. NZNOG will collect payment when you sign up as part of the conference registration. If you'd like to attend but need to pay for this separately to your conference registration, you can do so by adding a new registration under the same name. Of course, partners are welcome; just create a registration under their name.
